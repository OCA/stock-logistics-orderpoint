- You can have cron jobs to execute the cleanup actions (see Configuration section).
- If you are in the 'Location Orderpoint Cleanup Group', you can launch manually the cleanup
  on the orderpoint form level:
    - Click on 'Cleanup replenishments'.
    - In the wizard, check the 'Run After' box if you want the orderpoint to be run after cleanup.
- You can also select several orderpoints from the list view and select the action 'Cleanup Stock Location Orderpoints'
  that will launch the wizard.
