orderpoints.

Use Cases / Context
===================

Location orderpoints module was designed (first) to generate
replenishment moves for particular stock locations. e.g.: we have a
reserve stock and a preparation stock.

As warehouse life is not static, moves for a product can be canceled,
preparation stock could have been refilled with another move, ...

So, generated moves from location orderpoints can become obsolete.

This module should help to clean orderpoint moves and regenerate moves.

Configuration
=============

-  There is a security group 'Location Orderpoint Cleanup Group'. Users
   that can have access to cleanup action should be in that group. By
   default, all users that are in 'Inventory/Administrator' are in that
   group.
-  You can configure crons to execute cleanup actions.

   -  Enable debug mode, go to Settings > Technical > Scheduled Actions
   -  Add a cron with:

      -  base model 'Stock Location Orderpoint'
      -  In python code, add a line 'model.run_cleanup(orderpoints,
         run_after)' where 'orderpoints' is a list of orderpoint ids and
         'run_after' is True if you want to run the orderpoint(s) after
         cleanup.
      -  If you want to cleanup ordepoints by replenish method, add a
         line 'model.run_cleanup_method(replenish_method, run_after)'
         where 'replenish_method' is 'fill_up' by default (depending on
         extension modules you have installed)

Usage
=====

-  You can have cron jobs to execute the cleanup actions (see
   Configuration section).
-  If you are in the 'Location Orderpoint Cleanup Group', you can launch
   manually the cleanup on the orderpoint form level:

   -  Click on 'Cleanup replenishments'.
   -  In the wizard, check the 'Run After' box if you want the
      orderpoint to be run after cleanup.

-  You can also select several orderpoints from the list view and select
   the action 'Cleanup Stock Location Orderpoints' that will launch the
   wizard.
