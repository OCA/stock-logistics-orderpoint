This module allows to upgrade the existing replenishment moves if a new
demand is triggered with higher priority.

Use Cases / Context
===================

Orderpoints have generated replenishments that have a normal priority
(e.g.: replenishments to cover average sales).

In the case a new demand is created that triggers a realtime orderpoint
and is already covered by the existing replenishment, the priority won't
be changed.

This could be problematic as users won't see the real high priority
replenishment moves.
