Orderpoints have generated replenishments that have a normal priority
(e.g.: replenishments to cover average sales).

In the case a new demand is created that triggers a realtime orderpoint and
is already covered by the existing replenishment, the priority won't be changed.

This could be problematic as users won't see the real high priority replenishment
moves.
